# Running

To start a dev web server, use `npm run dev`.
To run the native app, run `npm run dev` and `npm run app:dev`.

# Building

The website is split into two parts: the core webapp and the guide.
You can build them seperately using `npm run core:build` or `npm run guide:build`, or build them
together using `npm run build`.

To build the native app, run `npm run app-build`.
