All noteskins sources are in their respective Noteskin.ts files. If you are the owner of the noteskin and want it to be removed, please
contact me on GitHub.

Some best practices:
- Render note types using a RenderTexture for better performance (especially those with models)
- Use redirects as much as possible (less work for you!)
- Some scripts are provided in _scripts
